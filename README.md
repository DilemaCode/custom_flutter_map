# flutter_map: display a custom popup when the marker is tapped 



This project uses the [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) package to integrate a map and attach a custom popup to a specific marker when it is tapped.
Adding a specific marker on a FlutterMap generated some issues for many developers. [Here](https://github.com/johnpryan/flutter_map/issues/354) you can find more details. 


Read the  [Flutter_map: custom popup above theÂ marker](https://medium.com/p/732d26ef9bc7/edit) article on Medium for a detailed documentation.
